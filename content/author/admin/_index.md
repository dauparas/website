I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University working with [Mor Nitzan] (https://mornitzan.wixsite.com/mysite/) and collaborating with [Sergey Ovchinnikov] (http://site.solab.org/lab). My research interests lie in the application of mathematics and physics to complex and biological systems. I am particularly interested in using machine learning tools such as autoencoders and natural language models for protein structure prediction and design, and for analysis of single-cell RNA data. Moreover, I am fascinated by the quickly developing self-supervised and reinforcement learning fields. I investigated policy gradient and Q-learning algorithms at Microsoft Research, Cambridge while finishing my PhD in Biophysics with [Eric Lauga](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/lauga/).
