I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University working with [Mor Nitzan](http://mornitzan.wixsite.com/mysite/).
My research interests lie in the application of mathematics to complex and biological systems. I am particularly interested in representation learning for the analysis of single-cell RNA data. This analysis can reveal rare cell populations, regulatory relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development. Moreover, I am fascinated by the quickly developing reinforcement learning field. I investigated policy gradient and Q-learning algorithms at Microsoft Research after finishing my PhD in biophysics with [Eric Lauga](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/lauga/).
