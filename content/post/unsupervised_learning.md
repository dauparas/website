I will be following the UC Berkeley's [CS294-158 Deep Unsupervised Learning course](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp19/home) and sharing my short summaries and takeaways.

The course covers Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning with the focus on the theoretical foundations as well as their newly enabled applications. Stay tuned!

Topics:

* [Autoregressive Models]({ {< relref "autoregressive_models.md" >}})
* Lossless Compression
* Flow Models
* Latent Variable Models
* Bits-Back Coding
* Implicit Models
